# Ruby

## Solargraph

The recommended way to install the language server for ruby is to do it locally, per project by either including it in your Gemfile or `gem install solargraph`.  

`LspInstall ruby` works for basic cases but will fail silently for more complex projects.  This is a known [issue](https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim/issues/945)
